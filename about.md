What is this?
=============

YourLo.ca/tion is a simple service that finds your location, lets you request someone else's location, and can
track your location over time.

This service was developed primarily for Search and Rescue to locate lost people.
For more on that, read the [back story](backstory.md)

##How it works

It uses HTML5 and Javascript in your mobile browser to ask the phone to 
determine the location and an estimate of the error. It will also work on 
non-mobile browers on desktops, laptops and tablets.
