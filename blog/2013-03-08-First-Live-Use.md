First Live Use of YourLo.ca/tion
================================

In the interest of fairness, we would like to document both successful and 
unsuccessful uses of YourLo.ca/tion. We will define "success" when the service
returns a usable location that assists the work of Search and Rescue.

We will keep track and report on these uses here.

Today at 10:00 PST [Coquitlam SAR][1] was asked to assist the Coquitlam RCMP to 
locate a missing woman at her cabin Indian Arm. An RCMP member was on scene,
and was asked if he could send us his coordinates. The team was working on 
getting a helicopter to take us there, and some exact coordinates would have 
been useful.

He could not figure out how, so we used YourLo.ca/tion to send him a request.

Unfortunately his phone would not get a GPS lock or send it to us. The request
was sent and results were emailed to our address, but there were no coordinates,
just an error message. The member tried several times, to no avail.

This was confusing because his phone was an iPhone, and that model has been 
tested extensively.

SAR members found his location using other means, the the subject of the search
was found alive and well.

The interesting thing about this search is that it illustrates a different use
case than what we had originally intended for the service; in this case we were 
not using it to locate a missing person, just to get some exact coordinates on 
where to start a search.

We will follow up on this in the near future and see if we can figure out what 
the issue was.
