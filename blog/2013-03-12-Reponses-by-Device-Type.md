Responses by Device Type
========================

Well, we've been testing YourLo.ca/tion for a few weeks now, and some 400 or so
data points have been gathered by people using the [Locate](locate.md) service with 
different devices. Now's a good time to present some very general, non-identifying
summary statistics. This will be the first post in a short series analyzing the 
data.

First, a breakdown of the type of devices used to test the service.

The almost even split between Android and iPhone testers is probably skewed by my own use of an Android phone.

Also interesting is the number of Mac and PC users. As documented in the [limitations](limitations.md), 
the geolocation technique does not work well on devices that dont's have a GPS or 
some sort of mobility. Some people using the Chrome browser with a laptop will get
good results, but most PC and Mac users will see results in the thousands of meters.

OK for testing, but not the intended use.

More statistics later this week.
