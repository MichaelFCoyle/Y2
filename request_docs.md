#Use:

Use YourLo.ca/tion to request a lost person's location.

1. [Fill in the form](request.md) with the name of the agency you represent, and a
short message.
2. Hit Submit and this service will generate a "short url"
3. Copy the url, and text or email it to the subject of the search
4. Wait

When the subject clicks on the url, it will load a web page that will attempt
to determine their location, and email you at the address you enterd.

Remember to review the [limitations of this tool](limitations.md), and how to 
[interpret the results](interpreting.md).
