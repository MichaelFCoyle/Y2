YourLo.ca/tion
==============

We created YourLo.ca/tion as a service for Search and Rescue teams to find 
people who may not know how to use their smart phones to get their location.

The service has several advantages over other ways to send your location.

1. It includes an estimate of the error in the location. 
   Many other location services do not do this. An estimate of error is essential
   for SAR personnel to understand how accurate the location is, especially if the 
   mobile phone is remote, and in marginal conditions. 
2. It allows a SAR team to request a location from anyone
   Most other location sharing services require the sender to know the email address
   or phone number of the recipient. For Search and Rescue it would be quite unusual 
   for the subject of the search to know the phone number of the SAR team. This service
   allows the SAR team to send a simple message to the subject to request their position.
3. It does not require the sender or recipient to be a "member" of any social media community.
   Most other services require some sort of membership from the sender or receiver. This does not,
   which makes it easy to use in emergency situations.
