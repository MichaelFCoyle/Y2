Hello, and thanks for visiting.

We collect some information every time someone visits the web site. This helps us determine who is finding the site, and how they found out about us. We advertise, and it’s important to figure out how that’s working so we can stop paying for stuff if it doesn’t get any results. For this we use Google Analytics.  Google might use a tracking cookie for this purpose.

We also maintain substantial logs of each time this service is used. Since this service is location based, these logs record your location or the location of the person you've sent a request to. They also record the useragen string which identifies the hardware, software and browser versions of your mobile or desktop computer. The tratioanle for recording this information is twofold

1.  We use the information recorded to monitor the performance of our code so we can tell if code changes make improvements
2.  Since the service is related to emergency services and certain situations that could be life or death, logs are seen as relating to the well being of a possible subject. In this case, you could contact us directly to access the log if for some reason you do not receive the subject's location after a request.

This information is stored on highly redundant servers with world class security. In fact, we are using Google's infrastructure for storage. We consider this information private, and it would be a breach of good faith for us to reveal it to anyone but the original requesting party, and then only in time of a life or limb situation.

There is one condition where we might need to reveal your information, and that is when we are required by law. We will only do this when served with legal warrants, and then only after consulting a lawyer.

If you come to this web site and post in our forum you must know that anything you post is publicly available.
